# Popup Trigger URL for Elementor Pro

Currently you can trigger Elementor Pro's popups by click only on buttons or links inside Elementor. This plugin will help you to trigger your Elementor Pro's popup from anywhere even outside the Elementor's content.

**Please note:** This plugin are helpful when you want to trigger your popup from links outside the Elementor content, e.g. WordPress menu items, links in standard content, etc.

## How it works

1. Go to `Templates > Popups` and click the `Show URLs` button of the popup you want to show.
2. Copy the URL of the trigger type you chose (`toggle` is the most common type).
3. Paste the URL on any link that you want to use to trigger the popup (e.g. WordPress menu items via `Custom Links`).
4. **IMPORTANT:** You are **required** to set the `Display Conditions` settings of your popup to pages where you want the popup to show. Otherwise, your popup won't show up.
